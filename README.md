# Performance-of-sampling-algorithms-on-imbalanced-data
Applied five sampling algorithms (SMOTE, Adasyn, RUS, ROS, Gamma) to ten diverse imbalanced datasets. Analyzed the efficiency and performance of each of the sampling algorithms using Machine Learning classifiers such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and a Deep Neural Network (DNN). 
This research was published to IEEE and was done in a group of 4. The research was part of the course "Algorithms 1" and was conducted under Canadian University Dubai
